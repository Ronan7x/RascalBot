# BasedBot
A discord bot that does funny things (more or less a test) 

I am learning how to make bots for discord for my personal servers, to do things like automate tasks and allow me to have a single bot in my server instead of requiring mutliple closed source bots. 

(I always reset my bot token before uploading code so dont even try anything its a waste of time)
